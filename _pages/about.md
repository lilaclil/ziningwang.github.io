Welcome to my website! I am a PhD Candidate in Marketing at the Sauder School of Business, University of British Columbia (UBC). My advisor is Dr. [Yanwen Wang](https://www.sauder.ubc.ca/people/yanwen-wang).

As an empirical modeler, I aims to utilize both econometric and machine learning methods to address marketing challenges. My substantial research area lies in digital marketing and multimodal data analysis.

My thesis unravels the communication strategies used by influencers in live commerce, in which I extract granular textual, visual, and vocal features from live sales pitches, and estimates the sales impact of various influencer behaviors and traits, such as emphases in sales communication (i.e. product, promotion, and customer relationship building), emotional states, and voice modulation. In another project, I investigate the extrinsic and intrinsic motivations of content creators on a social media platform and shows that recognition from others (e.g. subscriptions, comments, and likes) tends to nudge inactive content creators to contribute more. The work was selected as the finalist in the [Inaugural 2020 RMP Data-Driven Research Challenge](https://connect.informs.org/communities/community-home/digestviewer/viewthread?GroupId=469&MessageKey=00e71c98-3c85-4b72-8064-d91b7456e1bd&CommunityKey=1d5653fa-85c8-46b3-8176-869b140e5e3c&tab=digestviewer).

Prior to joining Sauder, I received a Research Master’s degree in Marketing from Erasmus University and a Bachelor’s degree in Economics from Beijing Foreign Studies University.

**I am on the 2023-2024 academic job market.**
