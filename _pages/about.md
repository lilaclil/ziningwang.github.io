Welcome to my website! I am a fifth-year doctoral candidate at Sauder School of Business, University of British Columbia (UBC). My advisor is Dr. [Yanwen Wang](https://www.sauder.ubc.ca/people/yanwen-wang).

As an empirical modeler, I aim to utilize both econometric and deep learning methods to address marketing challenges. My research focuses on **digital marketing**. My recent projects have examined the impact of live commerce and the driving forces of user-generated content.

Prior to joining Sauder, I received a Research Master’s degree in Marketing from Erasmus University and a Bachelor’s degree in Economics from Beijing Foreign Studies University.

You can find my CV [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/j2rmdo4ii492po0/resume_Zining_Wang_UBC.pdf?dl=0).

**I am on the 2023-2024 academic job market.**
