Welcome to my website! I am an Assistant Professor of Marketing at Carroll School of Management, Boston College.
As an empirical modeler, I aim to utilize both econometric and deep learning methods to address marketing challenges. My primary research focuses on **digital marketing, prosocial behavior, and automated video analysis**.

I hold a Ph.D. from the University of British Columbia, an M.Sc. from Erasmus University, and a BEcon. from Beijing Foreign Studies University.

You can find my CV [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/ch12dx9b84rtmbxmqn9pk/resume_20240709.pdf?rlkey=836904clxtnobox6y4deyfurt&st=kqk5jdef&dl=0).
