Zining Wang is a fifth-year doctoral candidate at the Sauder School of Business, University of British Columbia (UBC). As an empirical modeler, Zining aims to utilize both econometric and machine learning methods to address marketing challenges. Her substantial research area lies in digital marketing and multimodal data analysis. Her thesis unravels the communication strategies used by influencers in live commerce, in which she extracts granular textual, visual, and vocal features from live sales pitches, and estimates the sales impact of various influencer behaviors and traits, such as emphases in sales communication (i.e. product, promotion, and customer relationship building), emotional states, and voice modulation. In another project, she investigates the extrinsic and intrinsic motivations of content creators on a social media platform and shows that recognition from others (e.g. subscriptions, comments, and likes) tends to nudge inactive content creators to contribute more. The work was selected as the finalist in the Inaugural 2020 RMP Data-Driven Research Challenge. Prior to joining Sauder, she received a Research Master’s degree in Marketing from Erasmus University and a Bachelor’s degree in Economics from Beijing Foreign Studies University.
