I taught *Introduction to Marketing* (COMM 296) at Sauder School of Business, UBC, during the 2021-2022 academic year. I incorporated frontier marketing research, especially advances in digital marketing, into the course design.

I am honored to receive the ***Paul Chwelos Memorial Graduate Scholarship (Teaching Excellence Award)***.

I also had the opportunity to deliver a guest lecture on automated video analysis for the *Customer Analytics* (BAMA 520) course, which is a part of the Master of Business Analytics (MBAN) program at Sauder.

The following is a list of my teaching assistantship duties at Sauder:
