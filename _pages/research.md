My substantial research area focuses on digital marketing. My recent research projects inspect:
- the sales lift of live commerce
- effectiveness of live-streamers' communication strategies
- intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivations of content creators on social media

In terms of methodologies, I intertwine econometric methods with advances in computer science. I approach research questions using a variety of techniques, such as instrumental methods, maximum likelihood methods, Bayesian statistics, synthetic controls, natural language processing, and computer vision.

My long-term research goal is to seek innovative solutions to marketing challenges in the digital era. Specifically, I'd like to decode the vast amount of unstructured data that consumers encounter every single day, and investigate their impact on consumer behavior, particularly in the context of video-based marketing.

 - This research aims to unravel the mystique of selling in live commerce. While the effectiveness of sales efforts is of vital importance for companies, sales practices are often treated as a “black box” and are avoided in strategic discussions. To address this challenge, we leverage a unique live-streaming dataset to characterize and investigate the sales impact of three selling strategies, with sales pitches focused on product, promotion, and customer relationship management (CRM), respectively. Through developing an automated, deep-learning-based framework, we extract granular textual, visual, and vocal features from 3,069 live product showcases broadcasted by 111 live-streamers on a leading online marketplace in China in 2020. Our findings indicate that product-focused sales pitches have a significant impact on live-streaming sales, such that on average, a 10% increase in the ratio of product-related content to CRM-related content triggers a 11% increase in live-streaming sales. This sales lift related to product-focused sales pitches, however, wanes as the follower size of live-streamers decreases, and can even be negative for micro live-streamers. Conditional on discount depth, live- streamers are unlikely to achieve higher live-streaming sales by giving more priority to promotion-focused sales pitches. Our work documents the effectiveness of selling strategies in the digital era.
- **Sales Impacts of Live Streaming** *Invited for Resubmission to Marketing Science* Yanwen Wang, Shuai Yang, Hongju Liu, and Zining Wang.
 - This research investigates the sales impacts of live-streaming videos. We estimate live-streaming elasticities for 304 apparel brands by merging the brands’ product-level national sales with a complete record of product-level live-streaming activities from a leading online marketplace in China. Our empirical analysis suggests that live-streaming videos on e-commerce platforms have a positive sales impact on 64% of brands. Specifically, a 100% increase in the median brand’s live-streaming events will increase the sales of its promoted product by 16.8%. Meanwhile, live-streaming activity has no sales impact on 19% of brands, and a negative sales impact on the remaining 17% of brands. Brand strength moderates the live-streaming effects. Strong brands are found to have the most responsive live-streaming elasticity. The effectiveness of live-streaming videos also varies across host types, with the live-streaming videos hosted by brands being the most effective, followed by star influencers, micro influencers, and the plat- form. The estimated live-streaming elasticities are robust given alternative model specifications and measures. The documented live-streaming elasticities support the emergence of live-streaming videos as a viable new form of communication channel for sales.
