My recent research projects inspect:
- sales lift of in-house vs. outsourced livestreaming
- effectiveness of live-streamers' communication strategies
- prosocial influencer behavior

In terms of methodologies, I intertwine econometric methods with advances in computer science. I approach research questions using a variety of techniques, such as instrumental methods, maximum likelihood methods, grouped fixed effects, natural language processing, computer vision, and Generative AI.

My long-term research goal is to seek innovative solutions to marketing challenges in the digital era. Specifically, I'd like to decode the vast amount of unstructured data that consumers encounter every single day, and investigate their impact on consumer behavior.
